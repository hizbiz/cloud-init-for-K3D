# k3d-keda-rabbitmq-pika-example

This is a sample repository that shows a step to step guide on how to setup a [K3D](https://k3d.io) [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster environment on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). We will create a [K3D](https://k3d.io) [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster, install [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) and [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) in it, then create a sample Python application with pika to publish jobs to the RabbitMQ queue and consume messages from it (to simulate worker that does the job). Addionally a [helm charts](https://helm.sh/) to install this sample application into the cluster will be demonstrated as well.
